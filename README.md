# Senior_Year
This is a collection of projects, assignments, and anything else associated with my senior year of college. 

## CPTR355
### Computer Graphics
Introduction to computer graphics modeling, animation, and rendering. Students will use modern graphics libraries to perform basic geometric transformations, texture mapping, ray tracing, modeling of curves and surfaces, shading, and 2-D and 3-D object manipulation and animation. Students will write an interactive video game showcasing these features.

## CPTR454
### Design and Analysis of Algorithms
Design and analysis of efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and other applications. Students will design algorithms using techniques such as divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, and dynamic programming; and give proofs of correctness for their algorithms. Students will also analyze an algorithm's time and space complexity and give examples of NP-complete and NP-hard problems.
