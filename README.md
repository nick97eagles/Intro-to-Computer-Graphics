This is a collection of projects, assignments, and anything else associated with my senior year of college. 

## CPTR355 Computer Graphics
Introduction to computer graphics modeling, animation, and rendering. Students will use modern graphics libraries to perform basic geometric transformations, texture mapping, ray tracing, modeling of curves and surfaces, shading, and 2-D and 3-D object manipulation and animation. Students will write an interactive video game showcasing these features.
